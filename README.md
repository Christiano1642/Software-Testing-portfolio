### Reflections

#### 1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is both functional and secure, I follow best practices in software development. This includes writing clear, maintainable code and implementing thorough testing strategies, such as unit tests, integration tests, and security tests. By using tools like JUnit for testing and applying secure coding practices, I can identify and address potential vulnerabilities early in the development process. Regular code reviews and automated testing in a continuous integration pipeline also help maintain the quality and security of the software.

#### 2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs involves active communication with stakeholders to gather requirements through various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops. I ensure that I fully understand the user’s expectations and constraints by creating detailed requirement specifications. These requirements guide the design and development of the software, ensuring that the final product meets the user’s needs. Throughout the development process, I continuously validate that the evolving software aligns with the initial requirements through regular feedback loops and testing against the defined use cases.

#### 3. How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements and identifying the core functionalities needed. I typically start with a high-level design, creating diagrams such as flowcharts or UML diagrams to visualize the architecture and interactions within the system. I then break down the design into smaller components or modules, ensuring that each is well-defined and loosely coupled. This modular approach allows for easier testing, maintenance, and scalability. I also prioritize security and performance in my design decisions, considering potential risks and incorporating safeguards early in the design phase.
